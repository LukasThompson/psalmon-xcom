Thankyou for buying the Arteria3d Shanty Town Pack

The folder once unzipped contains a variety of folders - there are multple engine format versions, e.g. obj, fbx etc.
Then there is the normal map and texture folder.  Simply copy the contents of the texture folder into one of the specific game engine
formats you wish to use, then put that folder in your game engine project folder.

you do not need to copy the normal maps if you dont intend to use them.

Pack contents can be used royalty free, but must not be sold as models/textures etc, aside from using them in your game project.
Also, please credit us on your credits page

Best wishes and enjoy the pack

Steve, Arteria3d
